# TripAdvisor-dashboard
🚀 Just completed a comprehensive data analysis dashboard on Tripadvisor! 🏨

I've developed an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides deep insights into hotel data from Tripadvisor. Here’s a snapshot of what the dashboard includes:

- Key Metrics: Total Hotels, Average Number of Rooms, Average Score, and User Average Reviews.
- Visual Insights:
 - Distribution of hotels by star rating.
 - Breakdown of hotel amenities and services.
 - Top 10 hotels by total rooms.
 - User reservation trends across different continents and periods.
 - Analysis of traveler types and user distribution by continent.

This project highlights my ability to leverage Tableau for data visualization and analysis, transforming raw data into actionable insights. I’m excited to apply these skills in a professional setting and am open to new opportunities in data analysis and visualization.

Looking forward to connecting with recruiters and professionals in the data industry!
